It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"### Welcome to Roadcrew.js\r\nRoadcrew.js is a small JavaScript component which lets you switch pages of an single file website. This is very useful in combination with for example [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org). While you are of course able to jump between different HTML files it is more efficient in many cases not to reload the whole view. The idea is not new. I have found it first in jQuery Mobile. As I am not a huge fan of jQuery Mobile I wanted to migrate away from it, but just keep this feature. The resulting code has been named Roadcrew.js, because I listened to \"We are the Roadcrew\" from Mot√∂rhead when I started it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nRoadcrew.js has been developed by Christian Grobmeier (Github / Twitter: @grobmeier).
