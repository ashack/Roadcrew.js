Roadcrew.js / Roadcrew.dart
===========================

Roadcrew.js is a simple JavaScript snippet which allows
"page transitions" like in jQuery mobile. It means,
you can have multiple divs in a HTML5 document which
serve as "pages". Roadcrew.js allows you to navigate
between them.

Roadcrew.dart is the same, just in Dart (http://www.dartlang.org).
Personally I think this language is just great and I really enjoyed
working with it.

Roadcrew does not allow you to load new divs via Ajax.

Currently there is only one "transition" effect: flip, without anything.


Why?
----

Roadcrew.js has been developed because jQuery mobile
was very slow on my mobiles. The only feature I would
miss was the page feature, which is now available with
Roadcrew.js.

Roadcrew.dart has been developed because I love Dart.


Current stack for mobile
------------------------

Not that anybody wants to hear it. Lucky me, README files can be huge. So I can tell the
world about my current stack for HTML5 dev on mobile.

- Apache Cordova (was Phonegap)
- Roadcrew.js
- Promise.js (https://github.com/stackp/promisejs) for AJAX (see also: http://bit.ly/HbKRU4)
- Twitter Bootstrap
- jQuery



Future
------

I plan to remove jQuery in favour to Zepto.js: http://zeptojs.com/
In other terms: Roadcrew.js will have Zepto.js support too.
Plans are to keep jQuery support for this library.

For Roadcrew.dart I was thinking about creating bindings for Apache Cordova. That said, Dart is still in
it early days and the Roadcrew.dart development will reflect that.
